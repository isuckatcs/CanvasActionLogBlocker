# CanvasActionLogBlocker
  A small bruteforce script that prevents Canvas from detecting you leaving the quiz page

# Requirements
  - Tampermonkey or any similar userscript manager

# How to use
  1. Add the script to Tampermonkey by clicking [here](https://github.com/drieda/CanvasActionLogBlocker/raw/main/CanvasLogBlocker.user.js)
  2. Replace "{-YOUR_INSTITUTE_URL-}" to the Canvas url of your institute <br>
      *Note: only replace the placeholder mentioned above, leave anything else unchanged*

# Test environment
  - Google Chrome 88.0.4324.146
  - Tampermonkey v4.11
  - 2021.02.03

# Use at your own risk
  The script has been tested but that doesn't mean there is not a single rare case <br>
  when Canvas detects you leaving the page.
  
  Also note the environment the script was tested in. You might get a different result <br>
  in a different browser.
